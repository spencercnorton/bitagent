# System Tab — Diagnostics & Tools

The System tab is the operator's debugging surface. Open it any time a metric on the Dashboard tab looks wrong, a Sonarr indexer test fails, or the dashboard responds with a non-200 you can't explain. Four sub-tabs: **Health Check**, **Torznab Test**, **GraphQL Explorer**, **Raw Metrics**.

## When to open the System tab

A short triage table:

| Symptom | First sub-tab to open |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard stat cards stuck at 0 / `--` | Health Check → Connectivity Test |
| Sonarr/Radarr indexer test fails | Torznab Test |
| GraphQL queries hanging or 500ing | GraphQL Explorer |
| Grafana dashboards show wrong/missing series | Raw Metrics |
| `[Errno 111] Connection refused` in dashboard logs | Health Check (BitAgent Core card) |

## Health Check walkthrough

Health Check is three side-by-side cards, each verifying one subsystem.

**BitAgent Core card.** One row per upstream endpoint:

- **GraphQL API** — `OK` when `${BITAGENT_GRAPHQL_URL}` returns a valid GraphQL envelope on a probe query. Degraded states: `connection refused` (core not running), `timeout` (core overloaded), `404 not found` (URL wrong), `500 internal server error` (core has a bug — open the core's container logs).
- **Torznab Endpoint** — `OK` when the configured Torznab base returns the caps XML on `?t=caps`. The same failure modes as above, plus `401` if `TORZNAB_API_KEY` is set on the core but the dashboard isn't sending it.
- **Metrics** — `OK` when `${BITAGENT_METRICS_URL}` returns Prometheus exposition format with `bitagent_*` series. `OK` here is required for the Dashboard tab's stat cards to populate.

**Dashboard card.**

- **FastAPI** — `Running`. (Hard to fail; if you can see the page, FastAPI is running.)
- **SQLite DB** — `Connected` when the `/data/bitagent-ui.db` file is readable + writable. Common failure: the volume mount has the wrong permissions; the dashboard's container user can't write.
- **Auth Mode** — the active resolution method on the *current request*: `Open` (when `REQUIRE_AUTH=false`), `API Key`, `NPM`, `Forwarded-User`, or `SSO`.

**Network card.** Bound port readouts (read directly from the bound socket, not from config — so a config drift is visible here):

- **DHT Port** — `4413/udp`. The crawler's BEP-5 listen port.
- **Torznab Port** — `3333/tcp`. The core's HTTP port (also serves GraphQL + metrics).
- **Dashboard Port** — `8080/tcp` (or the value of `APP_PORT`). The FastAPI bind.

A `--` value on any row indicates the socket isn't bound — usually a startup failure; check container logs.

## Connectivity Test

The **Run All Checks** button runs every Health Check probe synchronously and reports a per-check latency. Use it after:

- Firewall changes.
- VPN provider switches on the bitagent core (e.g. NordVPN → AirVPN).
- Container recreations where you've changed env vars.
- Adding a reverse proxy / SSO gateway in front of the dashboard.

Latency expectations: GraphQL and Metrics probes should be sub-50ms on localhost / private LAN, sub-200ms across continents. Over 1s on any check usually means a timeout retry rather than slow latency — check the core's load.

## Torznab Test recipes

Use the Torznab Test sub-tab when `*arr` says "0 results" or "test failed" but you suspect the issue is on the `*arr` side. The sub-tab takes a query string and submits it against the configured BitAgent core.

### TV episode search

```text
?t=tvsearch&q=breaking+bad+s05e16&apikey=<TORZNAB_API_KEY>
```

Should return XML with `<item>` blocks for any matching releases.

### Movie by IMDb ID

```text
?t=movie&imdbid=tt0944947&apikey=<TORZNAB_API_KEY>
```

Note `imdbid` is the bare IMDb identifier *without* the `tt` prefix in some `*arr`s — Torznab itself accepts both. If you get zero results with `tt0944947` and the title-search returns hits, drop the `tt`.

### Music by artist + album

```text
?t=music&artist=Pink+Floyd&album=Animals&apikey=<TORZNAB_API_KEY>
```

If you get zero results: `BitAgent`'s caps endpoint must declare `music-search` for Lidarr to call this category. Confirm the core has classified at least one music torrent — otherwise caps suppresses the music category and Lidarr never sends the query.

## GraphQL Explorer recipes

The Explorer is a minimalist text-area + Run button — not GraphiQL. No autocomplete, no schema browser. Use it to verify schema after a core upgrade.

### List the most recent 10 torrents

```graphql
query {
  torrentContent {
    search(input: { queryString: "", limit: 10 }) {
      items {
        infoHash
        title
        contentType
        seeders
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Classifier recent decisions

```graphql
query {
  classifier {
    recentDecisions(limit: 10) {
      infoHash
      verdict
      score
      reason
    }
  }
}
```

(Schema availability depends on core version — check via introspection if the field is missing.)

## Raw Metrics

The Raw Metrics sub-tab streams `/metrics` in Prometheus exposition format. Use this to verify that the metric names your Grafana dashboards expect actually exist on this version of the core. Most useful counters:

- `bitagent_dht_peers_total` — current DHT routing table size. Should be in the hundreds within minutes of bootstrap, low thousands after a few hours.
- `bitagent_torrents_indexed_total` — cumulative count of admitted torrents. Monotonic; rate of change is the indexing throughput.
- `bitagent_classifier_decisions_total{verdict="..."}` — cumulative classifier decisions by verdict (`admit`, `reject`, `defer`). The reject:admit ratio is a useful spam pressure indicator.
- `bitagent_torznab_requests_total{category="..."}` — cumulative Torznab queries from `*arr`. If this is zero, your `*arr` isn't actually polling.
- `bitagent_csam_blocklist_export_total{outcome="..."}` — outcome of the post-classify CSAM defense hook (`blocked`, `skipped_no_match`).

For Grafana scraping, point the Prometheus job at the same URL the dashboard reads — `${BITAGENT_METRICS_URL}` — not at the dashboard. The dashboard is a consumer, not a producer.
