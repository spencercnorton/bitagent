Self-hosted, high-performance BitTorrent DHT crawler and content indexer.
Drop it into your *arr stack as a Torznab-compatible indexer and let the
public DHT fill the gaps your private trackers miss.

BitAgent is a 2026 fork of
[bitmagnet](https://github.com/bitmagnet-io/bitmagnet), which went dormant
in July 2025. We picked up where upstream left off and added classification,
evidence learning, a dashboard, and multi-tier auth.

MIT-licensed. No telemetry. No accounts. Just an indexer you own.

## Feature highlights

- **DHT crawling** --
  Full BEP-5/9/10/33/42/43/51 compliance for broad,
  resilient peer discovery
- **CEL-based classifier with optional LLM rerank** --
  Rule-driven content classification that can escalate ambiguous
  matches to a language model for a second opinion
- **Evidence pipeline** --
  Webhook feedback from Sonarr, Radarr, and the rest of the *arr
  family becomes ground-truth, so the classifier improves over time
- **Multi-tier auth** --
  API-key, reverse-proxy header, forwarded-user, and SSO --
  pick the layer that fits your network
- **Operator dashboard** --
  FastAPI + vanilla JS with six tabs covering crawl health,
  classifier metrics, evidence review, retention, and more
- **TMDB poster integration** --
  Movie and series results include poster art pulled from TMDB
- **Retention controls** --
  Age-off, category filters, and manual purge so your database
  stays the size you want
- **Wantbridge** --
  Active content acquisition that prioritizes torrents matching
  items your *arr clients are actually searching for
- **Torznab API** --
  First-class compatibility with Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr,
  Lidarr, and Readarr -- add BitAgent as a custom indexer
  and you are done
