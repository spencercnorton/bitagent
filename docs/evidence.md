# Evidence Pipeline

The Evidence tab is the closed-loop feedback signal that distinguishes BitAgent from a naïve Torznab provider. Every successful `*arr` import is a ground-truth label that flows back into BitAgent's classifier weights — over time, the classifier becomes sharper at distinguishing real releases from spam in the *operator's* taste profile.

## Why ground-truth evidence matters

BitAgent's classifier is initially heuristic — it scores torrents from name + size + DHT metadata. But heuristic scores have a ceiling: spam packs that look real and real packs that look spammy both fool a name-only classifier some of the time.

The fix is feedback. The full loop:

```text
DHT firehose
  → classifier (heuristic admit/reject)
     → indexed Library
        → Torznab response to *arr
           → *arr grabs the magnet
              → qBittorrent / Transmission downloads
                 → *arr imports + Plex/Jellyfin scans
                    → *arr POSTs webhook → /api/evidence
                       → BitAgent re-weights classifier on (name, verdict) pair
                          → next pass, similar names get the same verdict faster
```

Every loop tightens the classifier on this operator's library. Two operators with identical BitAgent installs and different `*arr` collections end up with subtly different classifiers — and that's the point.

## Configuring `*arr` to fire webhooks

Same shape across Sonarr / Radarr / Lidarr / Readarr. Walk-through with Sonarr:

1. **Settings → Connect → Add → Webhook**
2. **Name**: `BitAgent Evidence`
3. **URL**: `https://bitagent.example.com/api/evidence`
4. **Method**: `POST`
5. **Triggers**: enable **On Grab**, **On Import (Existing File)**, **On Import (New File)**. Skip other triggers — they're noise.
6. **Save**

Click **Test** before saving. A 200 OK means the dashboard accepted the synthetic payload; check the dashboard's Recent Activity table — a synthetic test event should appear within a refresh tick. If you get a 401, see the [Authentication section of the UI Guide](ui-guide.md#authentication) — the webhook needs to either come from inside the trust zone (private network / private LAN, with `REQUIRE_AUTH=false`) or carry the `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` as `?apikey=` in the URL.

Repeat for Radarr (`Settings → Connect`), Lidarr, and Readarr. URLs are identical; only the source application name on each event distinguishes them.

## What gets logged

Every webhook POST writes one row to the `evidence` table. Captured fields:

- **TIME** — receipt timestamp (ISO 8601, dashboard-local).
- **SOURCE** — `sonarr` | `radarr` | `lidarr` | `readarr` (parsed from the payload's `applicationUrl` or `instanceName`).
- **TORRENT** — release title + infohash (from the `release.releaseTitle` field).
- **TYPE** — `grab` | `download` | `import`.
- **RESULT** — outcome flag normalised from the `*arr`-specific success indicator.

The full payload is also persisted in the audit log (Settings → Audit Log) for forensic replay; the Evidence tab shows the structured projection.

## RESULT semantics

Three terminal states:

- **success** — the `*arr` accepted the file. Plays in Plex/Jellyfin. The strongest positive signal — the classifier upweights the (name pattern, verdict) pair.
- **failed** — the `*arr` rejected the import. Common causes: size mismatch (file shorter than indexed), codec mismatch (HEVC when profile wants AVC), truncated download, hash mismatch, malformed media. Strong negative signal — the classifier downweights the matching pattern.
- **duplicate** — the `*arr` already had this content (matched on title/quality). Neutral signal: the torrent was a real release, but the operator already has it. Used by the Library view to suppress duplicate entries.

Failed events are the most useful diagnostic data — they're often the smoking gun for either a misclassified torrent type or a `*arr` config problem (e.g. a too-strict quality profile). Sort the Evidence table by `RESULT = failed` to triage.

## How the classifier uses evidence

Evidence rows accumulate (name regex pattern → verdict) pairs. The classifier consumes these pairs at the next training cycle (default: nightly, configurable in Settings → Classifier).

Concretely, for a candidate torrent name `N`:

1. Heuristic score `H(N)` from the existing rule weights.
2. Evidence prior `E(N) = sum(weight × similarity(N, evidence_pattern))` across all evidence rows.
3. Final admission verdict: `H(N) + λ·E(N) > threshold`.

`λ` (the evidence weight) is exposed in Settings → Classifier — start at `1.0`, lower it if you suspect overfitting to a specific show's naming, raise it if the classifier is admitting too much spam after weeks of feedback.

The longer the evidence log gets, the stronger `E(N)` is. After ~100 rows the classifier visibly tightens; after ~1000 it's noticeably better than a fresh install.

## Privacy

Every evidence row stays local, in the core's Postgres (`label_evidence`); the dashboard only reads it. Nothing is sent upstream — not to BitAgent.org, not to TMDB, not to any third party. The classifier weights derived from evidence also stay local.

To purge evidence (e.g. before sharing a snapshot, or to reset classifier bias), delete from the `label_evidence` table in the core's Postgres (the `bitagent-postgres` volume in the quickstart) — or drop that volume to reset everything the core knows. The dashboard's SQLite holds no evidence, so recreating the UI volume neither purges nor preserves it.
